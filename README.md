# Prediction-of-Life-Expectancy-Using-Socio-Economic-Indicators-A-Statistical-and-ML-Approach
This project analyzes and predicts life expectancy using secondary data from the World Health Organization. Statistical and machine learning models such as linear regression and random forest are applied in Python to identify key socio-economic and health factors influencing life expectancy.
Life expectancy is one of the most important indicators of a nation’s overall health and socio-economic 
development. It reflects the combined effects of healthcare facilities, economic growth, education, and 
lifestyle factors. Understanding the determinants of life expectancy helps governments and policymakers 
design effective public health strategies. 
With the availability of large publicly accessible datasets, secondary data analysis has become an essential 
tool in modern statistical research. Advances in statistical modelling and machine learning techniques 
enable accurate prediction and deeper understanding of complex relationships among variables. 
This project uses secondary data collected by the World Health Organization (WHO) to analyse and 
predict life expectancy using classical statistical models and machine learning algorithms implemented in 
Python
